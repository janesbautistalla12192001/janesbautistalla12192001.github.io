This is my Family, one of my favorite picture. My Mama Dedith, Papa Edwin and Kuya James. There is no perfect family 'coz u know sometimes we get in trouble but no matter what problems we go through we stay and strong together. So I'm very blessed, thankful to God that I have a complete and happy family. <br>
